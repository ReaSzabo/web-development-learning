                        Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals collectively called
                        elephants and mammoths. These are terrestrial large mammals with a snout modified into a trunk
                        and teeth modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two
                        genera, Loxodonta (African elephants) and Elephas (Asiatic elephants), are living.
                        The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821,[4] and later assigned to taxonomic
                        ranks within the order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include
                        or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.

                        The Curculionidae are the family of the "true" weevils (or "snout beetles"). They are one of the
                        largest animal families, with 6,800 genera and 83,000[1] species described worldwide. They are
                        the sister group to the family Brentidae.[2]

                        They include the bark beetles as the subfamily Scolytinae, which are modified[unreliable
                        source?] in shape in accordance with their wood-boring lifestyle. They do not much resemble
                        other weevils, so they were traditionally considered a distinct family, Scolytidae. The family
                        also includes the ambrosia beetles, of which the present-day subfamily Platypodinae was formerly
                        considered the distinct family Platypodidae.

                        Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all
                        semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a
                        branch of the Mustelidae family, which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines,
                        among other animals.

            Learning:
            1. We put the content to a table, so the we will have 3 columns. (It is not a used structure nowadays, but the exam wants that solution.)
            2. The width of pics become 300px.
            3. We set font style to the whole page. (style tag - font-family)
            4. We set custom font size for h1 and h2.
            5. h1 tag is aligned in the middle. (style tag - text-align)
            6. The bug image is from an online source (see: src attribute)
            7. td cells are aligned to the top. (style tag - vertical-align)
