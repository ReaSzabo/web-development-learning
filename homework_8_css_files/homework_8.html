    <!--
        Show all bunny images (bunny1.png, bunny2.png, bunny3.png, bunny4.png, bunny5.png)
        Each one of them should get a name from you.
        Show the names with <h1> above the <img> tags.
        Use different colors for them.
        You can use only imported CSS files for the styling. (no style tag and insline styling are allowed).

        Tip #1: use divs for h1+img blocks.
        Tip #2: modify the display style attribute of the body to show them horizontally aligned.
